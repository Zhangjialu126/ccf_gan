# CCF-GAN on BigGAN Platform
This code is just some modification from the original Pytorch BigGAN repository.

## How To Install
Follow the steps in the original BigGAN-Pytorch repo: https://github.com/ajbrock/BigGAN-PyTorch.

## How To Use
We have provided example scripts. Briefly speaking, the CCF-GAN method is enabled by mainly specifying ```--which_train_fn CFGAN```.

## Special Thanks
* The basis of the CCF-GAN is built upon the official BigGAN-Pytorch at https://github.com/ajbrock/BigGAN-PyTorch.
